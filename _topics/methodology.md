## Our methodology

Below are the core principles we try to follow. This might change over time as we steelman the techniques but we had to start somewhere.

1. Use structured [reasons and arguments][Dutilh Novaes & Zalta, 2021].
2. If possible, use arguments based on [evidence][Kelly & Zalta, 2016], [science][Hepburn et al., 2021], and [rationalism][Markie et al., 2021].
3. Use a [hierarchy of evidence][Schünemann et al., 2022] that generally values certain types of evidence higher than others in the following order:
    1. [Experimental studies][Franklin et al., 2021] by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. [Meta-analyses and systematic reviews][Lasserson et al., 2022] of the following types of studies
        2. [Randomized controlled trial][Reiss et al., 2022] (RCT) experiments: Patients are randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group (not receiving the intervention) and the groups are compared, hopefully controlling for [confounding variables][Lu, 2009]:
             1. Placebo-controlled: A placebo is assumed to have no or minimal effect
             2. Non-placebo-controlled
             3. Versions of the above two types:
                 1. Triple blinded (patient, experimenters, and data analyst)
                 2. Double blinded (patient and experimenters)
                 3. Single blinded (patient)
                 4. Unblinded
        2. Experiments without a control group
            1. Experiments on groups
            2. Experiments on individuals (case studies)
        3. Experiments exploring a [mechanism of action][Craver et al., 2019]
    2. Correlational/observational studies by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the following types of studies
        2. [Cohort studies][Euser et al., 2009]: Follow one exposed group and a non-exposed group (control) and compare outcomes.
            1. Prospective: Baseline is assessed and then researchers actively follow patients to perform a follow-up: More accurate data collection
            2. Retrospective: Historical analysis of existing data
        3. [Case-control studies][Lu, 2009]: Follow one group with an outcome and another without an outcome (control) and compare exposure.
        4. [Cross-sectional studies][Lu, 2009]: Analyze whether individuals were exposed and whether they had certain outcomes and compare to those that didn't (control).
        5. Observations without a control group
            1. Observations of groups
            2. Observations of individuals (case studies)
        6. [Ecological studies][Lu, 2009]: Similar to cross-sectional studies but groups are analyzed instead of individuals
    3. Simulated [model][Frigg et al., 2020] results by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    4. Opinions by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Groups of experts
        2. Individual experts
    5. All of the above but not in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    6. All of the above but not by experts

### Caveats

1. There are potential issues with the concept of a hierarchy of evidence<sup>[1][Stegenga, 2018],[2][Blunt, 2015]</sup>.
1. A lack of evidence higher in the hierarchy is not necessarily problematic due to [infeasibility][Smith & Pell, 2003], ethical issues, etc.
1. There are potential issues with specific types of evidence; for examples:
    1. RCTs: [Simpson's Paradox][Sprenger et al., 2021]
1. There are [potential issues][Ioannidis, 2005] with all types of evidence; for examples:
    1. Lacking or poor reproduction
    2. Small effect sizes
    3. Poor study design or methodology
    4. Poor [external validity][Reiss et al., 2022]
    5. Biases (conflicts of interest, funding sources, etc.)
    6. Mistakes (data entry, variable coding, statistics, over-interpretation, etc.)
    7. p-hacking
    8. Fraud
1. In some cases, evidence lower in the hierarchy may be stronger; for example, a well-done experiment might be stronger than a poorly done RCT.
