## Our methodology

Below are the core principles we try to follow. This might change over time as we steelman the techniques but we had to start somewhere.

1. Use structured reasons and arguments ([Dutilh Novaes & Zalta, 2021](#Dutilh_Novaes_&_Zalta,_2021)).
2. If possible, use arguments based on evidence ([Kelly & Zalta, 2016](#Kelly_&_Zalta,_2016)), science ([Hepburn et al., 2021](#Hepburn_et_al.,_2021)), and rationalism ([Markie et al., 2021](#Markie_et_al.,_2021)).
3. Use a hierarchy of evidence ([Schünemann et al., 2022](#Schunemann_et_al.,_2022)) that generally values certain types of evidence higher than others in the following order:
    1. Experimental studies ([Franklin et al., 2021](#Franklin_et_al.,_2021)) by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews ([Lasserson et al., 2022](Lasserson_et_al.,_2022)) of the following types of studies
        2. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiments ([Reiss et al., 2022](#Reiss_et_al.,_2022)): Patients are randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group (not receiving the intervention) and the groups are compared, hopefully controlling for confounding variables ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)):
             1. Placebo-controlled: A placebo is assumed to have no or minimal effect
             2. Non-placebo-controlled
             3. Versions of the above two types:
                 1. Triple blinded (patient, experimenters, and data analyst)
                 2. Double blinded (patient and experimenters)
                 3. Single blinded (patient)
                 4. Unblinded
        2. Experiments without a control group
            1. Experiments on groups
            2. Experiments on individuals (case studies)
        3. Experiments exploring a mechanism of action ([Craver et al., 2019](#Craver_et_al.,_2019))
    2. Correlational/observational studies by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the following types of studies
        2. Cohort studies ([Euser et al., 2009](#Euser_et_al.,_2009)): Follow one exposed group and a non-exposed group (control) and compare outcomes.
            1. Prospective: Baseline is assessed and then researchers actively follow patients to perform a follow-up: More accurate data collection
            2. Retrospective: Historical analysis of existing data
        3. Case-control studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Follow one group with an outcome and another without an outcome (control) and compare exposure.
        4. Cross-sectional studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Analyze whether individuals were exposed and whether they had certain outcomes and compare to those that didn't (control).
        5. Observations without a control group
            1. Observations of groups
            2. Observations of individuals (case studies)
        6. Ecological studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Similar to cross-sectional studies but groups are analyzed instead of individuals
    3. Simulated model ([Frigg et al., 2020](#Frigg_et_al.,_2020)) results by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    4. Opinions by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Groups of experts
        2. Individual experts
    5. All of the above but not in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    6. All of the above but not by experts

### Other general points

1. We use the heuristic that mistakes are generally made due to incompetence rather than malice ([Bloch, 2003](#Bloch,_2003)), although the latter is certainly possible.
1. When comparing arguments, the number of points doesn't necessarily matter.

### Caveats

1. There are potential issues with the concept of a hierarchy of evidence ([Stegenga, 2018](#Stegenga,_2018); [Blunt, 2015](#Blunt,_2015)).
1. A lack of evidence higher in the hierarchy is not necessarily problematic due to [infeasibility][Smith & Pell, 2003], ethical issues, etc.
1. There are potential issues with specific types of evidence; for examples:
    1. RCTs: Simpson's Paradox ([Sprenger et al., 2021](#Sprenger_et_al.,_2021))
1. There are potential issues with all types of evidence ([Ioannidis, 2005](#Ioannidis,_2005)); for examples:
    1. Lacking or poor reproduction
    2. Small effect sizes
    3. Poor study design or methodology
    4. Poor external validity ([Reiss et al., 2022](#Reiss_et_al.,_2022))
    5. Biases (conflicts of interest, funding sources, etc.)
    6. Mistakes (data entry, variable coding, statistics, over-interpretation, etc.)
    7. p-hacking
    8. Fraud
1. In some cases, evidence lower in the hierarchy may be stronger; for example, a well-done experiment might be stronger than a poorly done RCT.
