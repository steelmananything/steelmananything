## Our methodology

Below are the core principles we try to follow. This might change over time as we steelman the techniques but we had to start somewhere.

1. Use structured reasons and arguments ([Dutilh Novaes & Zalta, 2021](#Dutilh_Novaes_&_Zalta,_2021); [Walton, 1988](#Walton,_1988)).
2. If possible, use arguments based on evidence ([Kelly & Zalta, 2016](#Kelly_&_Zalta,_2016)), science ([Hepburn et al., 2021](#Hepburn_et_al.,_2021)), and rationalism ([Markie et al., 2021](#Markie_et_al.,_2021)).
3. Use a hierarchy of evidence ([Schünemann et al., 2022](#Schunemann_et_al.,_2022)) that generally values certain types of evidence higher than others in the following order:
    1. Experimental studies ([Franklin et al., 2021](#Franklin_et_al.,_2021)) by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews ([Lasserson et al., 2022](Lasserson_et_al.,_2022)) of the following types of studies
        2. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiments ([Reiss et al., 2022](#Reiss_et_al.,_2022); [Kendall, 2003](#Kendall,_2003)): Patients are randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group (not receiving the intervention) and the groups are compared, hopefully controlling for confounding variables ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)):
             1. Placebo-controlled: A placebo is assumed to have no or minimal effect
             2. Non-placebo-controlled
             3. Versions of the above two types:
                 1. Triple blinded (patient, experimenters, and data analyst)
                 2. Double blinded (patient and experimenters)
                 3. Single blinded (patient)
                 4. Unblinded
        2. Experiments without a control group
            1. Experiments on groups
            2. Experiments on individuals (case studies)
        3. Experiments exploring a mechanism of action ([Craver et al., 2019](#Craver_et_al.,_2019))
    2. Correlational/observational studies by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the following types of studies
        2. Cohort studies ([Euser et al., 2009](#Euser_et_al.,_2009)): Follow one exposed group and a non-exposed group (control) and compare outcomes.
            1. Prospective: Baseline is assessed and then researchers actively follow patients to perform a follow-up: More accurate data collection
            2. Retrospective: Historical analysis of existing data
        3. Case-control studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Follow one group with an outcome and another without an outcome (control) and compare exposure.
        4. Cross-sectional studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Analyze whether individuals were exposed and whether they had certain outcomes and compare to those that didn't (control).
        5. Observations without a control group
            1. Observations of groups
            2. Observations of individuals (case studies)
        6. Ecological studies ([Lu, 2009](#Lu,_2009)): Similar to cross-sectional studies but groups are analyzed instead of individuals
    3. Simulated model ([Frigg et al., 2020](#Frigg_et_al.,_2020)) results by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    4. Opinions by experts in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
        1. Groups of experts
        2. Individual experts
    5. All of the above but not in peer-reviewed, scientific journals
    6. All of the above but not by experts
4. Use a [burden of proof](/topics/methodology/#burden-of-proof)

### Burden of Proof

A burden of proof is an expectation by one side about the strength of argument required by another side for persuasion. A burden of proof may be useful to establish the core of a debate and avoid an argument going on indefinitely ([Walton, 1988b](#Walton,_1988b)). A burden of proof may assert controversial philosophical or ethical premises, but we think this is still valuable in clarifying the context and exit criteria of an argument.

### Other general points

1. We use the heuristic that mistakes are generally made due to incompetence rather than malice ([Bloch, 2003](#Bloch,_2003)), although the latter is certainly possible.
1. When comparing arguments, the number of points doesn't necessarily matter.

### Caveats

1. There are potential issues with the concept of a hierarchy of evidence ([Anglemyer et al., 2014](#Anglemyer_et_al.,_2014); [Frieden, 2017](#Frieden,_2017); [Stegenga, 2018](#Stegenga,_2018); [Blunt, 2015](#Blunt,_2015)).
1. A lack of evidence higher in the hierarchy is not necessarily problematic due to [infeasibility][Smith & Pell, 2003], ethical issues, etc.
1. There are potential issues with specific types of evidence; for examples:
    1. RCTs: Simpson's Paradox ([Sprenger et al., 2021](#Sprenger_et_al.,_2021))
1. In some cases, evidence lower in the hierarchy may be stronger; for example, a well-done experiment might be stronger than a poorly done RCT.
1. There are potential issues with all types of evidence ([Ioannidis, 2005](#Ioannidis,_2005)); for examples:
    1. Lacking or poor reproduction, or too much reproduction ([Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007](#Ioannidis_&_Trikalinos,_2007))
    1. Statistically significant but false effects due to low statistical power ([Button et al., 2013](#Button_et_al.,_2013))
    1. Non-random sampling ([Carlisle, 2017](#Carlisle,_2017))
    1. Small effect sizes
    1. Poor study design or methodology
    1. Poor external validity ([Reiss et al., 2022](#Reiss_et_al.,_2022))
    1. Incorrect statistical controls ([Westfall & Yarkoni, 2016](#Westfall_&_Yarkoni,_2016))
    1. Mistakes (data entry, variable coding, statistics, over-interpretation, etc.)
    1. Multiple comparisons ([Bennett et al., 2009](#Bennett_et_al.,_2009))
    1. p-hacking, researcher degrees of freedom, multiple potential comparisons, or fishing expeditions ([Simmons et al., 2016](#Simmons_et_al.,_2016); [Humphreys et al., 2013](#Humphreys_et_al.,_2013); [Gelman & Loken, 2013](#Gelman_&_Loken,_2013))
    1. Fraud ([Smith, 2021](#Smith,_2021); [Van Noorden, 2022](#Van_Noorden,_2022); [Adam, 2019](#Adam,_2019))
    1. Conflicts of interest ([Lundh et al., 2010](#Lundh_et_al.,_2010); [Angell, 2009](#Angell,_2009))
    1. Poor incentives ([Nosek et al., 2012](#Nosek_et_al.,_2012))
    1. Poor instrument or method reliability ([Vul et al., 2009](#Vul_et_al.,_2009))

To put it another way: without modern statistics, we find it unlikely that people would take seriously a claim about the general population of women, based on two survey questions asked to 100 volunteers on the internet and 24 college students. But with the p-value, a result can be declared significant and deemed worth publishing in a leading journal in psychology."&#013;&#013;"absent pre-registration, our data analysis choices will be data-dependent, even when they are motivated directly from theoretical concerns. When pre-registered replication is difficult or impossible (as in much research in social science and public health), we believe the best strategy is to move toward an analysis of all the data rather than a focus on a single comparison or small set of comparisons"&#013;&#013;"In fields where new data can readily be gathered (such as in all four of the examples discussed above), perhaps the two-part structure of Nosek et al. (2013) will be a standard for future research. Instead of the current norm in which several different studies are performed, each with statistical significance but each with analyses that are contingent on data, perhaps researchers can perform half as many original experiments in each paper and just pair each new experiment with a pre-registered replication."&#013;&#013;Gelman, A., & Loken, E.

All those reasons for not taking research fraud seriously have proved to be false, and, 40 years on from Lock’s concerns, we are realising that the problem is huge, the system encourages fraud, and we have no adequate way to respond.

[Walton, 1988]: https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00178024 '"This description of reasoned dialogue as a process of deepened insight into one's own position on a controversial issue is consistent with the Socratic view of dialogue as a means to attain self-knowledge. For Socrates, the process of learning was an ascent from the depths of the cave towards the clearer light of self-knowledge through the process of reasoned, and primarily verbal, dialogue with another discussant, on controversial issues. What Socrates emphasized as a most important benefit or gain of dialogue was self-knowledge. It was somehow through the process of articulation and testing of one's best arguments against an able opponent in dialogue that real knowledge was to be gained.&#013;&#013;This Socratic point of view draws our attention to the more hidden and subtle benefit of good, reasoned dialogue. Not only does it enable one to rationally persuade an opponent or co-participant in discussion, but it is also the vehicle that enables one to come to better understand one's own position on important issues, one's own reasoned basis behind one's deeply held convictions. It is the concept of burden of proof that makes such shifts of rational persuasion possible, and thereby enables dialogue to contribute to knowledge."&#013;&#013;Walton, D. N. (1988).

[Walton, 1988b]: https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00178024 '"One of the most trenchant and fundamental criticisms of reasoned dialogue as a method of arriving at a conclusion is that argument on a controversial issue can go on and on, back and forth, without a decisive conclusion ever being determined by the argument. The only defence against this criticism lies in the use of the concept of the burden of proof within reasoned dialogue. Once a burden of proof is set externally, then it can be determined, after a finite number of moves in the dialogue, whether the burden has been met or not. Only by this device can we forestall an argument from going on indefinitely, and thereby arrive at a definite conclusion for or against the thesis at issue."&#013;&#013;Walton, D. N. (1988b).
