## Quick Summaries

### Oversimplified summaries of key points

* [Mainstream view steelman](#steelman-mainstream-view): Vaccines are correlated with dramatic reductions of deaths & morbidity, most people being vaccinated helps protect others through herd immunity, there have been multi-year, randomized controlled scientific trials of vaccines versus saline placebo that have not shown concerning all-cause impacts in the vaccine group, and the burden of proof is on those proposing excessive skepticism of vaccines.
* [Skeptical of mainstream view steelman](#steelman-response-skeptical-of-mainstream-view): Claims that vaccines dramatically reduced deaths & morbidity are based on incomplete models, recent natural experiments of the DTP vaccine in Africa have shown multiple times worse all-cause mortality in the vaccine group, herd immunity doesn't apply to many vaccines, post-approval surveillance may report fewer than 1% of adverse events, 70% of scientific vaccine trials of currently licensed vaccines in the U.S. were based on studies that did not use a control or did not use saline placebo, vaccines such as the Hepatitis B vaccine given to children on the first day of life in the U.S. were based on studies without any control and babies were monitored for less than 6 days, some saline placebo randomized & controlled trials have shown worse severe disease in the vaccine group after many years particularly in children, and the burden of proof is on those proposing to avoid performing larger, randomized, controlled, saline placebo trials and/or epidemiological investigations of vaccinated versus under- or un-vaccinated.

### Detailed single sentence summaries

* [Mainstream view steelman](#steelman-mainstream-view): Peer-reviewed scientific evidence shows that vaccines are correlated with dramatically reduced deaths, morbidity, and hospitalizations, that vaccine skepticism has been correlated with spikes of deaths and morbidity, that most individuals being vaccinated may protect vulnerable people that can't take vaccines or for whom vaccines are ineffective through herd immunity, that randomized & controlled vaccines are correlated with full or near elimination of smallpox and polio, that vaccine scientific trials show safety and efficacy even over multi-year, saline placebo randomized & controlled clinical trials, that potential adverse effects continue to be investigated and rare adverse events compensated, and that it's widely believed to be unethical and impractical to perform better randomized & controlled trials, and the burden of proof is on those proposing excessive skepticism of vaccines.
* [Skeptical of mainstream view steelman](#steelman-response-skeptical-of-mainstream-view): Peer-reviewed scientific evidence shows that modeling of vaccine impacts on reduced deaths, morbidity, and hospitalizations mostly ignores the impacts of other drivers of reductions such as when nearly all of a disease reduction happened before a vaccine was even introduced or when the introduction of a vaccine didn't accelerate disease reduction, that spikes of deaths and morbidity correlated with vaccine skepticism hasn't taken into account all-cause deaths and morbidity, that recent natural experiments of the DTP vaccine in Africa have shown statistically significant, multiple times worse all-cause mortality in the vaccine group, that some correlational evidence shows all-cause mortality isn't significantly different between vaccinated and undervaccinated or fully unvaccinated children, that some correlational evidence shows the number of vaccines given is correlated with increased infant mortality, that herd immunity doesn't apply to many vaccines, that randomized & controlled vaccine scientific trials are not robustly designed to evaluate safety of adverse events, that some serious vaccine adverse effects & deaths are documented and accepted even by mainstream science, that billions of dollars of compensation have been paid in the U.S. for vaccine injuries, that adverse events of vaccines generally exceed the incidences of most childhood diseases in advanced countries, that post-approval surveillance may report fewer than 1% of adverse events, that there are significant correlations between vaccination and chronic health conditions, that 70% of scientific vaccine trials of currently licensed vaccines in the U.S. were based on studies that did not use a control or did not use saline placebo and often the vaccines used as controls weren't themselves studied versus saline placebo despite some cases of high adverse event rates and death, that vaccines such as the Hepatitis B vaccine given to children on the first day of life in the U.S. were based on studies without any control and babies were monitored for less than 6 days, that most routine childhood vaccines in the U.S. were licensed without inactive saline placebo trials, that some saline placebo randomized & controlled trials have shown worse severe disease in the vaccine group after many years particularly in children, and the burden of proof is on those proposing to avoid performing larger, randomized, controlled, saline placebo trials and/or epidemiological investigations of vaccinated versus under- or un-vaccinated.

## Background on Vaccines

The immune system attacks perceived threats (called pathogens) through mechanisms such as adaptive defenses that learn to respond to antigens that are molecules on or released by pathogens ([Lam et al., 2024](#Lam_et_al.,_2024)).

This learning process includes creating B and T memory cells that may respond more quickly to future re-infections by the same or similar antigens ([Lam et al., 2024](#Lam_et_al.,_2024)).

Vaccines are injections, sprays, drops, etc. containing antigens or something that creates antigens with the goal of stimulating such immunological memory ([Papania et al., 2017](#Papania_et_al.,_2017)).

Vaccines contain other ingredients including adjuvants that stimulate the immune system (e.g. aluminum, squalene oil, polysorbate, etc.), antibiotics (e.g. mercury) & preservatives that reduce risks of contamination, stabilizers that reduce changes due to environmental exposures, surfactants, diluents, and residual materials from the production process (e.g. virus molecules, bacteria molecules, DNA, cell culture residuals, etc.) ([Vanderslott et al., 2019](#Vanderslott_et_al.,_2019); [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 2025](#Children's_Hospital_of_Philadelphia,_2025); [Offit & Jew, 2003](#Offit_&_Jew,_2003); [Delany et al., 2014](#Delany_et_al.,_2014)).

A normal part of the immune response involves inflammation and increased blood flow and this may cause fever, redness, swelling, pain, aches, etc. and it's expected that this inflammation may occur both with pathogens and vaccines ([Hervé et al., 2019](#Herve_et_al.,_2019)).

The following steelmen are for general points across all vaccines and separate steelmen are needed for each specific vaccine.

### Steelman: Mainstream View

1. Epidemiology:
    1. Modeling shows vaccines avoided over 150 million deaths (including over 100 million infants) over the past 50 years worldwide ([Shattock et al., 2024](#Shattock_et_al.,_2024); [Zhou et al., 2024](#Zhou_et_al.,_2024); [Rodrigues & Plotkin, 2020](#Rodrigues_&_Plotkin,_2020); [Zhou et al., 2005](#Zhou_et_al.,_2005); [Zhou et al., 2014](#Zhou_et_al.,_2014); [Whitney et al., 2014](#Whitney_et_al.,_2014); [Roush et al., 2007](#Roush_et_al.,_2007); [U.S. CDC, 1999b](#U.S._CDC,_1999b)) and annually reduce severe disease, hospitalizations and impact up to over $1 trillion in reduced medical costs and increased economic benefits in the U.S. as an example ([Ozawa et al., 2016](#Ozawa_et_al.,_2016)).
    1. A natural experiment occurred when concerns about DTwP vaccine side effects led to reduced pertussis vaccination in countries such as Japan that was [correlated](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with increases of dozens of pertussis deaths in the late 1970s; then, when an acellular version of the vaccine (DTaP) was introduced, pertussis cases and deaths subsequently declined in the early 1980s ([Kimura & Kuno-Sakai, 1990](#Kimura_&_Kuno-Sakai,_1990); [Ellenberg & Chen, 1997](#Ellenberg_&_Chen,_1997)). A similar thing happened with whooping cough and pertussis cases in the U.S. in the 1970s & 1980s ([Rawlins, 1995b](#Rawlins,_1995b)).

    1. Insufficient community vaccination may endanger those that cannot get a vaccine due to being immunocompromised (e.g. cancer treatment, etc.), contraindications, too young, ineffective immune response, cost, availability, etc. because of reduced herd immunity ([Rodrigues & Plotkin, 2020d](#Rodrigues_&_Plotkin,_2020d); [Orenstein & Ahmed, 2017](#Orenstein_&_Ahmed,_2017); [Zimmermann & Curtis, 2019](#Zimmermann_&_Curtis,_2019)).
    1. Vaccines eliminated smallpox, polio (in advanced countries), and rinderpest (in livestock) thus completely eliminating those pathogens and the morbidity and mortality they cause ([Parrino & Graham, 2006](#Parrino_&_Graham,_2006); [Henderson, 2011](#Henderson,_2011); [Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015](#Bandyopadhyay_et_al.,_2015)). Smallpox had been around since at least 1,000 BC ([Rodrigues & Plotkin, 2020b](#Rodrigues_&_Plotkin,_2020b)).
    1. There are no known causal relationships between vaccines and chronic or autoimmune diseases (e.g. asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, hay fever, etc.) ([Offit & Jew, 2003](#Offit_&_Jew,_2003); [McCormick et al., 2002](#McCormick_et_al.,_2002)).
1. Safety:
    1. About 30% of [currently approved vaccines in the U.S.](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states) were approved based on randomized controlled trials that used inactive saline placebo with placebo groups up to 18,098 patients (average of 2,181) and monitoring for severe adverse reactions up to 6 years (average of about 10 months) with similar rates of reported severe adverse reactions and all cause mortality ([Steelman Anything, 2025](#Steelman_Anything,_2025); [U.S. FDA, 2006](#U.S._FDA,_2006); [U.S. FDA, 2007](#U.S._FDA,_2007); [U.S. FDA, 2009d](#U.S._FDA,_2009d); [U.S. FDA, 2009g](#U.S._FDA,_2009g); [U.S. FDA, 2013](#U.S._FDA,_2013); [U.S. FDA, 2015](#U.S._FDA,_2015); [U.S. FDA, 2019](#U.S._FDA,_2019); [U.S. FDA, 2019c](#U.S._FDA,_2019c); [U.S. FDA, 2020](#U.S._FDA,_2020); [U.S. FDA, 2020b](#U.S._FDA,_2020b); [U.S. FDA, 2023f](#U.S._FDA,_2023f); [U.S. FDA, 2023j](#U.S._FDA,_2023j); [U.S. FDA, 2023k](#U.S._FDA,_2023k); [U.S. FDA, 2023l](#U.S._FDA,_2023l); [U.S. FDA, 2023m](#U.S._FDA,_2023m); [U.S. FDA, 2023s](#U.S._FDA,_2023s); [U.S. FDA, 2024d](#U.S._FDA,_2024d); [U.S. FDA, 2024e](#U.S._FDA,_2024e); [U.S. FDA, 2024f](#U.S._FDA,_2024f); [U.S. FDA, 2024g](#U.S._FDA,_2024g); [U.S. FDA, 2024h](#U.S._FDA,_2024h); [U.S. FDA, 2024n](#U.S._FDA,_2024n); [U.S. FDA, 2024o](#U.S._FDA,_2024o); [U.S. FDA, 2024p](#U.S._FDA,_2024p); [U.S. FDA, 2024q](#U.S._FDA,_2024q); [U.S. FDA, 2024s](#U.S._FDA,_2024s); [U.S. FDA, 2024t](#U.S._FDA,_2024t); [U.S. FDA, 2025](#U.S._FDA,_2025); [U.S. FDA, 2025f](#U.S._FDA,_2025f); [U.S. FDA, 2025h](#U.S._FDA,_2025h); [U.S. FDA, 2025i](#U.S._FDA,_2025i); [U.S. FDA, 2025l](#U.S._FDA,_2025l); [Rid et al., 2014](#Rid_et_al.,_2014)).
    1. About half of saline placebo studies included children younger than 18 years old and as young as 6 months with placebo groups up to 1,354 patients (average of 647) and monitoring for severe adverse reactions up to 6 years (average of about 9 months) with similar rates of reported severe adverse reactions and all cause mortality ([Steelman Anything, 2025](#Steelman_Anything,_2025); [U.S. FDA, 2006](#U.S._FDA,_2006); [U.S. FDA, 2009d](#U.S._FDA,_2009d); [U.S. FDA, 2013](#U.S._FDA,_2013); [U.S. FDA, 2019](#U.S._FDA,_2019); [U.S. FDA, 2023k](#U.S._FDA,_2023k); [U.S. FDA, 2023m](#U.S._FDA,_2023m); [U.S. FDA, 2023s](#U.S._FDA,_2023s); [U.S. FDA, 2024e](#U.S._FDA,_2024e); [U.S. FDA, 2024p](#U.S._FDA,_2024p); [U.S. FDA, 2024q](#U.S._FDA,_2024q); [U.S. FDA, 2024s](#U.S._FDA,_2024s); [U.S. FDA, 2025](#U.S._FDA,_2025); [U.S. FDA, 2025i](#U.S._FDA,_2025i); [U.S. FDA, 2025l](#U.S._FDA,_2025l)).
    1. For example, a randomized controlled trial using inactive saline placebo for the Zostavax shingles vaccine trial in adults included thousands of placebo recipients monitored for about 5 years and did not show statistically significantly more reported severe disease, hospitalization or all cause mortality ([U.S. FDA, 2019c](#U.S._FDA,_2019c)).
    1. Vaccinations correlated with [serious adverse events](https://www.fda.gov/safety/reporting-serious-problems-fda/what-serious-adverse-event) such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), etc. may be [spurious correlations](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) ([Ellenberg & Braun, 2002](#Ellenberg_&_Braun,_2002)).
    1. Post-approval surveillance is used to monitor for side effects [correlated](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with vaccines ([Di Pasquale et al., 2016](#Di_Pasquale_et_al.,_2016); [U.S. CDC, 2024b](#U.S._CDC,_2024b)) and studied extensively ([U.S. CDC, 2024](#U.S._CDC,_2024)). Documented serious adverse events are extremely rare ([Maglione et al., 2014b](#Maglione_et_al.,_2014b)) though there are various limitations to surveillance systems such as the U.S. VAERS and VSD systems ([Salmon et al., 2024b](#Salmon_et_al.,_2024b)) and some rare serious adverse events are unavoidable ([Chen et al., 2001](#Chen_et_al.,_2001)). In the U.S., a vaccine injury court exists though some rulings have a low barrier of plausibility ([Offit, 2008](#Offit,_2008)).
    1. There's no strong evidence that there are problems receiving multiple vaccines at the same time (including as an infant) or when someone is non-severely ill ([Offit et al., 2002](#Offit_et_al.,_2002)).
1. Given that vaccines are correlated with dramatically reduced deaths, morbidity, and hospitalizations, that vaccine skepticism has been correlated with spikes of deaths and morbidity, that most individuals being vaccinated may protect vulnerable people that can't take vaccines or for whom vaccines are ineffective through herd immunity, that vaccines are correlated with full or near elimination of smallpox and polio, that randomized & controlled vaccine scientific trials show safety and efficacy even over multi-year, saline placebo randomized & controlled clinical trials, that potential adverse effects continue to be investigated and rare adverse events compensated, and that it's widely believed to be unethical and impractical to perform better randomized & controlled trials, then the [burden of proof](/topics/methodology/#burden-of-proof) is on those proposing excessive skepticism of vaccines.

#### Steelman Response: Skeptical of Mainstream View

1. Epidemiology:
    1. The modeling of deaths, hospitalizations and costs saved by vaccines may be a [spurious correlation](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) because at least 96.5% to 99.0% of the reduction in infectious disease mortality in advanced countries occurred before vaccines were widely available ([McKinlay & McKinlay, 1977](#McKinlay_&_McKinlay,_1977); [Guyer et al., 2000](#Guyer_et_al.,_2000); [Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971); [McKeown & Brown, 1955](#McKeown_&_Brown,_1955); [Cutler & Miller, 2005](#Cutler_&_Miller,_2005)), paralelled by non-vaccine treated diseases such as typhoid, scarlet fever, etc. ([Vanderslott et al., 2019](#Vanderslott_et_al.,_2019); [Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971)). Recent reductions of disease impacts in poorer countries may have had similar drivers ([Mahmood et al., 2014](#Mahmood_et_al.,_2014); [Cutler et al., 2006](#Cutler_et_al.,_2006)). This is in addition to other potential epidemiological confounders such as healthy vaccinee bias ([Remschmidt et al., 2015](#Remschmidt_et_al.,_2015)).
    1. For example, in the United States, measles vaccines were introduced in 1963 ([Conis, 2019](#Conis,_2019)) yet most of the reduction in measles deaths occurred before (first figure below) ([Grove & Hetzel, 1968](#Grove_&_Hetzel,_1968); [Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971)). Similarly, diphtheria vaccine was introduced in 1913 ([Colgrove, 2007](#Colgrove,_2007)) yet didn't accelerate the rate of diphtheria death decline (second figure below) ([Grove & Hetzel, 1968b](#Grove_&_Hetzel,_1968b); [Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971)). As a third example, a vaccine for pertussis came well after whooping cough deaths declined dramatically (third figure below) ([Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971)). There are similar trends for polio, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, etc. ([Kass, 1971](#Kass,_1971); [McKinlay & McKinlay, 1977](#McKinlay_&_McKinlay,_1977); [Guyer et al., 2000](#Guyer_et_al.,_2000)).

    <cite>Figure 4. Mean annual death rate from whooping cough in children under 15 years of age, England and Wales (Kass, 1971)</cite>
    1. The weaknesses of vaccine benefits modeling can be demonstrated with [Zhou et al., (2024b)](#Zhou_et_al.,_2024b); for example, the model estimates 85,000 deaths from measles between 1994-2023 (table 1) or about 2,833 deaths per year; however, annual deaths from measles in the U.S. were less than 1,000 by the 1950s ([Grove & Hetzel, 1968](#Grove_&_Hetzel,_1968); [U.S. Public Health Service, 1950](#U.S._Public_Health_Service,_1950)) before any measles vaccines were approved in 1963 ([Conis, 2019](#Conis,_2019)).
    1. A natural, uncontrolled experiment of the introduction of the DTP vaccine (one of the most widely used vaccines globally) in Africa in the 1970s and 1980s showed at least two fold, statistically significant worse all-cause mortality in the vaccine group which was hypothesized to be due to non-specific effects (NSEs) of non-live attenuated vaccines ([Aaby et al., 2018](#Aaby_et_al.,_2018); [Andersen et al., 2018](#Andersen_et_al.,_2018); [Mogensen et al., 2017](#Mogensen_et_al.,_2017); [Aaby et al., 2016](#Aaby_et_al.,_2016); [Higgins et al., 2016](#Higgins_et_al.,_2016); [Aaby et al., 2003](#Aaby_et_al.,_2003); [Benn, 2025](#Benn,_2025); [Benn et al., 2023](#Benn_et_al.,_2023); [Benn et al., 2020](#Benn_et_al.,_2020); [Bardenheier et al., 2017](#Bardenheier_et_al.,_2017)).
    1. Some [correlational](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) evidence shows that all-cause mortality isn't statistically significantly different between undervaccinated or unvaccinated children compared to children vaccinated per the recommended U.S. schedule ([McCarthy et al., 2017](#McCarthy_et_al.,_2017)).
    1. The number of vaccines and/or antigens or other ingredients in vaccines given in combination or in total may have increased risks ([Institute of Medicine, 2013b](#Institute_of_Medicine,_2013b); [Ellenberg & Chen, 1997d](#Ellenberg_&_Chen,_1997d); [Goldman, 2013](#Goldman,_2013); [Von Kries et al., 2005](#Von_Kries_et_al.,_2005); [Traversa et al., 2011](#Traversa_et_al.,_2011); [Australia Government, 2007](#Australia_Government,_2007); [Jablonowski & Hooker, 2004](#Jablonowski_&_Hooker,_2004)). Some evidence shows the number of vaccines given is [correlated](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with increased infant mortality ([Miller & Goldman, 2011](#Miller_&_Goldman,_2011); [Miller & Goldman, 2023](#Miller_&_Goldman,_2023); [Goldman & Miller, 2023](#Goldman_&_Miller,_2023)). Infant deaths (e.g. SIDS) reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) system showed that the number of days since vaccination was not randomly distributed ([Miller, 2021](#Miller,_2021)).
    1. Herd immunity is particularly effective when the pathogen is casually contagious and the vaccine reduces transmission. Tetanus is not contagious ([Hall et al., 2021c](#Hall_et_al.,_2021c)). Diphtheria vaccines may not significantly prevent transmission ([Miller et al., 1972](#Miller_et_al.,_1972)). Acellular pertussis vaccines may not significantly prevent transmission ([Warfel et al., 2014](#Warfel_et_al.,_2014); [Warfel & Merkel, 2014](#Warfel_&_Merkel,_2014)). Influenza vaccines may not significantly prevent transmission ([Jefferson et al., 2010](#Jefferson_et_al.,_2010); [Ohmit et al., 2013](#Ohmit_et_al.,_2013)). The MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine may wane significantly over time and that is not significantly helped with a third booster ([Fiebelkorn et al., 2016](#Fiebelkorn_et_al.,_2016)). The COVID-19 vaccine may not significantly prevent transmission ([Riemersma et al., 2022](#Riemersma_et_al.,_2022)). The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) may not significantly prevent transmission ([U.S. CDC, 2024c](#U.S._CDC,_2024c)). Hepatitis B is mainly spread through sexual contact, injection drug use, or being born to an infected mother ([Hall et al., 2021](#Hall_et_al.,_2021)). HPV is a sexually transmitted disease ([Hall et al., 2021b](#Hall_et_al.,_2021b)).
1. Safety:
    1. Despite the lack of evidence of a significant difference in severe adverse reactions and all cause mortality in saline placebo randomized controlled vaccine trials, their sample sizes are primarily designed to evaluate efficacy rather than the safety, including in subpopulations, and may purposefully exclude those who may be more susceptible ([Maglione et al., 2014](#Maglione_et_al.,_2014); [Chen, 1999c](#Chen,_1999c); [Ellenberg et al., 2005b](#Ellenberg_et_al.,_2005b); [Ellenberg & Braun, 2002b](#Ellenberg_&_Braun,_2002b)). Due to the nature of the statistics used, studies may also lack the ability to detect adverse effects that are otherwise common in the population ([Brewer & Colditz, 1999](#Brewer_&_Colditz,_1999)).
    1. Vaccines are accepted by mainstream science to cause at least a small number of serious adverse outcomes ([Ellenberg et al., 2005](#Ellenberg_et_al.,_2005); [Poland & Kennedy, 2022](#Poland_&_Kennedy,_2022)) including death ([U.S. CDC, 2022](#U.S._CDC,_2022)); although these should be evaluated relative to the risks of the vaccine-precentable disease, post-approval surveillance found [correlations](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with intussusception ([U.S. CDC, 1999](#U.S._CDC,_1999)), thrombocytopenia ([U.S. CDC, 2022](#U.S._CDC,_2022); [World Health Organization, 2023](#World_Health_Organization,_2023); [Ellenberg & Chen, 1997b](#Ellenberg_&_Chen,_1997b)), narcolepsy ([Nohynek et al., 2012](#Nohynek_et_al.,_2012); [Persson et al., 2014](#Persson_et_al.,_2014)), myopericarditis and ischemic cardiac events ([Varricchio et al., 2004b](#Varricchio_et_al.,_2004b); [Le Vu et al., 2022](#Le_Vu_et_al.,_2022); [U.S. FDA, 2022y](#U.S._FDA,_2022y); [Chua et al., 2021](#Chua_et_al.,_2021); [Buchan et al., 2022](#Buchan_et_al.,_2022)), Guillain-Barré syndrome ([Schonberger et al., 1979](#Schonberger_et_al.,_1979)), vaccine-induced polio and paralysis ([Rodrigues & Plotkin, 2020c](#Rodrigues_&_Plotkin,_2020c); [Offit, 2005](#Offit,_2005); [Alexander et al., 2004](#Alexander_et_al.,_2004)), encephalopathy ([Chen, 1999](#Chen,_1999)), neurological illness ([Miller et al., 1981](#Miller_et_al.,_1981)), aseptic meningitis ([DeStefano et al., 2001](#DeStefano_et_al.,_2001)), anaphylactic shock ([Ellenberg et al., 2005](#Ellenberg_et_al.,_2005)), viscerotropic and neurotropic disease ([Varricchio et al., 2004](#Varricchio_et_al.,_2004)), seizures ([Ellenberg & Chen, 1997c](#Ellenberg_&_Chen,_1997c)), and muscle pain, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, and pneumonia ([Fulginiti et al., 1967](#Fulginiti_et_al.,_1967); [Rauh & Schmidt, 1965](#Rauh_&_Schmidt,_1965)). In addition, various manufacturing and handling errors have caused serious illness and death ([Baker, 2008b](#Baker,_2008b); [Offit, 2005](#Offit,_2005); [Amanna & Slifka, 2018](#Amanna_&_Slifka,_2018); [Zhou et al., 2003b](#Zhou_et_al.,_2003b); [Wilson, 1967](#Wilson,_1967); [U.S. CDC, 2022](#U.S._CDC,_2022)) and exposure to other viruses such as SV-40 ([Ellenberg et al., 2005c](#Ellenberg_et_al.,_2005c)). Positive rechallenging has also suggested additional adverse events such as hair loss for some vaccines ([Ellenberg & Braun, 2002d](#Ellenberg_&_Braun,_2002d)).
    1. There are case reports of identical twins both dying shortly after vaccination ([Balci et al., 2007](#Balci_et_al.,_2007); [Mitchell et al., 2010](#Mitchell_et_al.,_2010); [Roberts, 1987](#Roberts,_1987); [Werne & Garrow, 1946](#Werne_&_Garrow,_1946)).
    1. The U.S. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has awarded $5.4 billion to 12,339 petitions since 1988, at least 3,626 of which were conceeded to be more likely than not that the vaccine caused the injury or the evidence supported fulfillment of the criteria of the Vaccine Injury Table ([U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration, 2025](#U.S._Health_Resources_&_Services_Administration,_2025); [U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration, 2025b](#U.S._Health_Resources_&_Services_Administration,_2025b)).
    1. Even if it's true that vaccine side affects are rare, vaccines are generally given preventively which may change ethical considerations and the burden of proof of safety studies, especially for healthy infants ([Chen, 1999b](#Chen,_1999b)), and adverse events [correlated](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with vaccines now exceed the incidences of most vaccine-preventable childhood diseases ([Chen, 1999d](#Chen,_1999d)).
    1. Post-approval surveillance may report fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events ([Lazarus et al., 2010](#Lazarus_et_al.,_2010); [U.S. Committee on Government Reform, 2000](#U.S._Committee_on_Government_Reform,_2000)), potential long-term adverse events are less likely to be reported ([Ellenberg & Braun, 2002c](#Ellenberg_&_Braun,_2002c); [Hasford et al., 2002](#Hasford_et_al.,_2002); [Rawlins, 1988](#Rawlins,_1988); [Feely et al., 1990](#Feely_et_al.,_1990)), about 14% are for serious adverse events ([Zhou et al., 2003b](#Zhou_et_al.,_2003b)), the system has major weaknesses ([Block, 2023](#Block,_2023); [Zhou et al., 2003](#Zhou_et_al.,_2003)), and major vaccine safety questions aren't well studied ([Salmon et al., 2024](#Salmon_et_al.,_2024)).
    1. There are statistically significant [correlations](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) between vaccination and chronic health conditions such as asthma, atopic disease, eczema, autoimmune disease and neurodevelopmental disorders when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated children ([Lamerato et al., 2020](#Lamerato_et_al.,_2020); [Cowling et al., 2012](#Cowling_et_al.,_2012); [Institute of Medicine, 2013](#Institute_of_Medicine,_2013); [Glanz et al., 2016](#Glanz_et_al.,_2016); [Mawson et al., 2017](#Mawson_et_al.,_2017); [Hooker & Miller, 2020](#Hooker_&_Miller,_2020); [Hooker & Miller, 2021](#Hooker_&_Miller,_2021); [Lyons-Weiler & Thomas, 2020](#Lyons-Weiler_&_Thomas,_2020); [Enriquez et al., 2005](#Enriquez_et_al.,_2005)).

In some randomized controlled trials with inactive placebo, results were statistically significantly worse in the vaccine group ([Liang et al., 2010](#Liang_et_al.,_2010); [Hoberman et al., 2003](#Hoberman_et_al.,_2003)). Active vaccine controls are sometimes used due to ethical concerns ([Rid et al., 2014b](#Rid_et_al.,_2014b)); however, active controls are generally only allowed when they were themselves tested against inactive placebo ([U.S. FDA, 2016](#U.S._FDA,_2016)). In some cases, the active controls were themselves never tested against saline placebo such as Prevnar 13 being tested against Prevnar 7 but Prevnar 7 not being tested against saline placebo (nor its meningococcal group C conjugate active control) and the Prevnar 13 trials showed up to 5.8% rates of serious adverse events including up to 0.29% rates of death ([U.S. FDA, 2002](#U.S._FDA,_2002); [U.S. FDA, 2017](#U.S._FDA,_2017)). Three groups could be used to evaluate inactive placebo versus active control versus vaccine ([U.S. FDA, 2001](#U.S._FDA,_2001)).
    1. For example, all hepatitis B vaccines given to babies on the day of birth in the U.S. were trialed without any control (neither saline nor active control) and babies were monitored for less than 6 days ([U.S. FDA, 2018b](#U.S._FDA,_2018b); [U.S. FDA, 2023v](#U.S._FDA,_2023v); [U.S. FDA, 1998b](#U.S._FDA,_1998b)). 
    1. Most [routine childhood vaccines in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf) were licensed without inactive saline placebo trials ([U.S. FDA, 1978](#U.S._FDA,_1978); [U.S. FDA, 1998](#U.S._FDA,_1998); [U.S. FDA, 2017](#U.S._FDA,_2017); [U.S. FDA, 2018](#U.S._FDA,_2018); [U.S. FDA, 2018c](#U.S._FDA,_2018c); [U.S. FDA, 2020c](#U.S._FDA,_2020c); [U.S. FDA, 2022](#U.S._FDA,_2022); [U.S. FDA, 2022c](#U.S._FDA,_2022c); [U.S. FDA, 2022e](#U.S._FDA,_2022e); [U.S. FDA, 2022k](#U.S._FDA,_2022k); [U.S. FDA, 2023](#U.S._FDA,_2023); [U.S. FDA, 2023b](#U.S._FDA,_2023b); [U.S. FDA, 2023o](#U.S._FDA,_2023o); [U.S. FDA, 2023t](#U.S._FDA,_2023t); [U.S. FDA, 2023u](#U.S._FDA,_2023u); [U.S. FDA, 2023w](#U.S._FDA,_2023w); [U.S. FDA, 2023x](#U.S._FDA,_2023x); [U.S. FDA, 2023y](#U.S._FDA,_2023y); [U.S. FDA, 2023z](#U.S._FDA,_2023z); [U.S. FDA, 2024w](#U.S._FDA,_2024w); [U.S. FDA, 2024y](#U.S._FDA,_2024y); [U.S. FDA, 2025j](#U.S._FDA,_2025j)).
    1. As one example of the possible importance of long trial durations, a randomized controlled trial using inactive saline placebo for the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine with thousands of participants and monitoring for 6 years showed initially positive results but after a few years showed statistically significantly more reported severe disease and hospitalization in the vaccinated, particularly the young, probably due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) ([Mersha et al., 2024](#Mersha_et_al.,_2024)) (though all-cause mortality was similar) and thus the vaccine is generally not recommended for young or previously uninfected persons in non-endemic areas ([U.S. FDA, 2023n](#U.S._FDA,_2023n); [Hadinegoro et al, 2015](#Hadinegoro_et_al,_2015)). This supports the idea of long, large, inactive placebo controlled trials, especially for children. ADE has been seen in at least influenza viruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, ebolaviruses, HIV, RSV, measles virus, and dengue virus ([Mersha et al., 2024b](#Mersha_et_al.,_2024b)).
    1. There may be potential allergic reactions to egg proteins, yeast proteins, gelatin, etc. ([Offit & Jew, 2003](#Offit_&_Jew,_2003)).
    1. Even if it's true that vaccines are [correlated](/topics/methodology/#causation-and-correlation) with reductions in the incidences of diseases as in the Japanese pertussis example or with the recent introduction of vaccines in poorer countries ([Rodrigues & Plotkin, 2020e](#Rodrigues_&_Plotkin,_2020e)), other aspects would need to be evaluated such as economic drivers that lead to better nutrition, sanitation, etc. ([Sala-i-Martin, 2006](#Sala-i-Martin,_2006)) and all-cause mortality & morbidity (e.g. those that died due to that reduction in Japanese pertussis vaccination may have been frail and died due to other causes), net risks & benefits, etc.
1. Given that modeling of vaccine impacts on reduced deaths, morbidity, and hospitalizations mostly ignores the impacts of other drivers of reductions such as when nearly all of a disease reduction happened before a vaccine was even introduced or when the introduction of a vaccine didn't accelerate disease reduction, that spikes of deaths and morbidity correlated with vaccine skepticism hasn't taken into account all-cause deaths and morbidity, that recent natural experiments of the DTP vaccine in Africa have shown statistically significant, multiple times worse all-cause mortality in the vaccine group, that some correlational evidence shows all-cause mortality isn't significantly different between vaccinated and undervaccinated or fully unvaccinated children, that some correlational evidence shows the number of vaccines given is correlated with increased infant mortality, that herd immunity doesn't apply to many vaccines, that randomized & controlled vaccine scientific trials are not robustly designed to evaluate safety of adverse events, that some serious vaccine adverse effects & deaths are documented and accepted even by mainstream science, that billions of dollars of compensation have been paid in the U.S. for vaccine injuries, that adverse events of vaccines generally exceed the incidences of most childhood diseases in advanced countries, that post-approval surveillance may report fewer than 1% of adverse events, that there are significant correlations between vaccination and chronic health conditions, that 70% of scientific vaccine trials of currently licensed vaccines in the U.S. were based on studies that did not use a control or did not use saline placebo and often the vaccine used as controls weren't themselves not studied versus saline placebo despite some cases of high adverse event rates and death, that vaccines such as the Hepatitis B vaccine given to children on the first day of life in the U.S. were based on studies without any control and babies were monitored for less than 6 days, that most routine childhood vaccines in the U.S. were licensed without inactive saline placebo trials, and that some saline placebo randomized & controlled trials have shown worse severe disease in the vaccine group after many years particularly in children, then the [burden of proof](/topics/methodology/#burden-of-proof) is on those proposing to avoid performing larger, randomized, controlled, saline placebo trials and/or epidemiological investigations of vaccinated versus under- or un-vaccinated.

## Notes

1. Inactive placebo for muscular injections is normally saline. Saline placebo is preferred over purified water for bloodstream injections because saline placebo is isotonic with blood plasma ([Wilcox, 1983](#Wilcox,_1983)). Non-saline water would be hypotonic and could cause extra blood cell death; however, a balanced crystalloid solution might be better than saline ([Hammond et al., 2022](#Hammond_et_al.,_2022)).

As an extension of the medical maxim ‘First do no harm,‘ tolerance of adverse reactions to products given to healthy persons -- especially healthy infants -- is substantially lower than to products administered to persons who are already sick. This lower risk tolerance for vaccines translate into a need to investigate the possible causes of much rarer adverse events following vaccinations than would be acceptable for other pharmaceutical products. For example, events occurring at ~⅒⁵-⅒⁶ doses like acute encephalopathy after whole cell pertussis vaccine, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) after swine in influenza vaccine and oral polio vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) are of concern for vaccines while side effects are essentially universal for cancer chemotherapy and 10-30% for persons on high dose aspirin therapy experience gastro-intestinal symptoms. [...] there are several factors directly related to the vaccine community, due either to our action or inaction, that may have contributed to the current unsatisfactory situation. [...] The cost and the difficulty of studying events increase with their rarity, however. [...] in countries where immunizations are mandated, increasing the availability of philosophical exemptions may provide a ‘relief valve‘. In such situations, close monitoring the risk of vaccine-preventable disease in unimmunized exempters and their subsequent transmission to the larger community may help dissuade others.

While such trials have advantages in their ability to assess causality of vaccine adverse events due to their experimental design, they are limited in their ability to provide data on rare, delayed, or reactions in subpopulations. Furthermore, the lack of standardization of case definitions for various adverse events (e.g. fever, fussiness) in such trials limit our ability to interpret and use these ‘safety‘ data. Due to these limitations, the ‘mantra‘ has been to rely on post-marketing surveillance to detect rare serious problems. Yet this has been more an aspiration than reality. [...] Similarly, current knowledge and research capability about rare vaccine risks is incomplete and limited, as noted in extensive reviews in early 1990's by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the United States. Two-third of the 76 vaccine adverse events evaluated by the IOM were found to have either no or inadequate evidence to assess for or against a vaccine cause. [...] as planes developed from propellers to jets, then jumbo jets and Concorde, the technology for improving aviation safety also evolved. Yes, in the event of an unfortunate crash, millions may have flown without difficulties, yet a careful investigation is still launched immediately to better understand this specific exception to the rule. Whatever changes needed, be it hardware, software, or policy, can then be identified and improved via systematic feedback. [...] While much investment may have been made in the hardware and software in the vaccine development and vaccine production, much of the surveillance tools for vaccine safety remains relatively primitive. Important strides have been made in developing newer large-linked databases for active surveillance of vaccine safety. Yet nowhere globally are such systems stably funded or fully operational. Imagine having radar to avoid plane crashes and not using them, or having them but without enough staff to monitor the radar screen.

[Chen et al., 2001]: https://doi.org/10.1086/322569 '"Most national vaccine safety monitoring systems rely on some type of passive surveillance (also called ‘spontaneous reporting‘) system, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States, to detect signals of potential safety concerns after licensure. For example, VAERS was the source of the signals for recent studies of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) that occurred after administration of influenza vaccine and of intussusception that occurred after administration of rotavirus vaccine. However, these signals were detected within VAERS to a large extent because both GBS and intussusception are relatively unusual, yet specific, medical events. Most of the approximately 11,000 VAERS reports received annually are not so specific, however. Because serious vaccine adverse events are rare, most reporters to VAERS are making such a report for the first time. In contrast to clinical trials, in which the data collection process is standardized, VAERS reports are extremely heterogeneous with regard to clinical evaluation. Thus, analysis of VAERS reports, with their hodgepodge of symptoms, signs, laboratory results, and diagnoses, can be extremely difficult.&#013;&#013;Another major factor that permitted the detection by VAERS of a possible increase in GBS after influenza vaccination was the manner in which the vaccine was administered. Influenza vaccine is usually administered alone, so there is little confusion about which vaccine may have caused the ensuing GBS (i.e., the specificity of exposure). Unfortunately, this is the exception rather than the rule for most VAERS reports.&#013;&#013;First, the scientific advance of vaccine safety has been hindered by a lack of standard case definitions. Unlike vaccine efficacy, which can be measured by examination of the differential incidence rate of a single outcome with its case definition (i.e., the vaccine-preventable disease), safety cannot be measured directly. Safety can only be inferred indirectly from the absence of multiple likely adverse events, each measured separately in the trial. Hitherto, the absence of standard case definitions for vaccine adverse events has prevented comparison of vaccine safety data across clinical trials—even across the diphtheria-tetanus–acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa) trials.&#013;&#013;Because infectious disease epidemiologists have had the greatest interest in developing new vaccines, historically the epidemiologists that serve on most such boards and committees have come from this group. Because serious adverse events are generally rare, however, the expertise necessary to interpret them lies more in the area of chronic or ‘rare‘ disease epidemiology. In the case of rotavirus vaccine and intussusception, a reviewer with such expertise might have noticed that 4 of 5 intussusception cases seen among 10,054 vaccine recipients occurred within 2 weeks of vaccination, whereas the single case seen among the 4633 placebo recipients occurred several weeks after vaccination. A binomial test for randomness would have shown close to borderline statistical significance, instead of the nonsignificant result yielded by the x2 test actually used by the researchers.&#013;&#013;Furthermore, the advent of Web-enabled standardized data collection raises the question of whether large, simple prelicensure safety trials might now be possible for vaccines, as were done for use of ibuprofen to treat children.&#013;&#013;Since 1990, the CDC has organized the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project to enable scientifically rigorous studies of vaccine safety to be conducted. Unfortunately, the VSD study population constitutes only 2% of the US population. It is therefore not large or diverse enough to answer many vaccine safety questions in a timely manner. For example, the immunization schedule and the specific vaccines used in the 4 health maintenance organizations in the VSD are more homogeneous than those used in the US population in general.&#013;&#013;Unlike most public health surveillance systems, which target a single exposure (e.g., lead) or a single disease outcome associated with a specific case definition (e.g., measles, salmonellosis), VAERS must conduct surveillance on multiple vaccine exposures and multiple disease outcomes (most without case definitions). In practical terms, this means hundreds of cross-tabulations in computer printouts that are inches deep and must be reviewed regularly by a human being for a possible signal. This is a process fraught with the risk that signals will be missed, because it is highly dependent on alertness and the experience of the reviewer. Not surprisingly, some VAERS signals arise as much from the persistence of a reporter as from prospective data review.&#013;&#013;Even with large linked data sets such as the VSD and sophisticated analyses, however, it might not be possible to control adequately for ‘confounding by contraindication‘. Children who are less healthy are less likely to receive vaccines in a timely manner. Such children are also at increased risk for poor medical outcome. This confounding is, in essence, the mirror image of the ‘healthy worker‘ effect in epidemiology.&#013;&#013;it may be possible to organize such a large, simple safety trial between licensure and mass adoption of a vaccine.&#013;&#013;some risk is inevitably associated with vaccination. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has been put in place to compensate those who are injured as a result of vaccination when, despite our best human efforts before or after licensure, some unexpected adverse events occur."&#013;&#013;Chen, R.

Prompted by a report from a concerned parent, FDA staff searched the VAERS database for similar cases and were somewhat surprised to find about 40 cases of alopecia that had been reported to VAERS over a period of years. The lag in detection may have been due at least in part to the fact that few, if any of these reports met the FDA definition of a serious adverse event (defined as death, hospitalisation, prolongation of hospitalisation, life-threatening illness or permanent disability) so they had not been a priority for review and follow-up. Although follow-up identified other possible causes in many cases (e.g. use of chemical hair treatments), there were several cases of ‘positive rechallenge‘: hair loss after vaccination, followed by regrowth and then hair loss again after the next vaccine dose. These cases provided a strong suggestion of a real, but clearly very rare, effect. Cases were reported in both children and adults; several different vaccines were involved but most cases included receipt of hepatitis B vaccine. Positive rechallenge represents a type of temporal relation that is particularly persuasive. Despite the absence of strong data supporting the other causality criteria, the high value usually placed on positive rechallenge data lends credibility to the potentially causal association between alopecia and vaccination."&#013;&#013;Ellenberg, S.

They are administered to millions of healthy people every year, and, unlike any therapeutic product, many vaccines are mandated for entry into schools, pre-school programs, and day care programs by most states, as well as during military service. Vaccines are known to cause a small number of extremely rare but serious adverse outcomes, such as vaccine-associated paralytic polio and anaphylactic shock, but are suspected by some to be responsible for a much larger number and wide variety of serious and chronic health problems. It is often difficult to address such concerns effectively because, as discussed earlier, evaluating vaccine safety in the postlicensure setting is very complicated. With vaccines, as with other widely used products, some serious medical events will occur coincidentally after administration. Often it is impossible at that time to ascertain the likelihood of any causal connection with the vaccine; because such events occur in the absence as well as the presence of vaccines, causal effect is rarely demonstrable."&#013;&#013;Ellenberg, S.

Such an adverse event would, however, affect as many as 4000 children a year in the United States alone.

[Institute of Medicine, 2013]: https://doi.org/10.17226/13563 '"Vaccinations—like all medical procedures—are neither 100 percent free of risk nor 100 percent effective. Vaccines, in rare cases, can cause illness. Most children who experience an adverse reaction to immunization have a preexisting susceptibility. Some predispositions may be detectable prior to vaccination; others, at least with current technology and practice, are not.&#013;&#013;No studies have compared the differences in health outcomes that some stakeholders questioned between entirely unimmunized populations of children and fully immunized children. Experts who addressed the committee pointed not to a body of evidence that had been overlooked but rather to the fact that existing research has not been designed to test the entire immunization schedule.&#013;&#013;The committee believes that although the available evidence is reassuring, studies designed to examine the long-term effects of the cumulative number of vaccines or other aspects of the immunization schedule have not been conducted.&#013;&#013;The conduct of an RCT would require thousands of participants to be of sufficient size to answer questions about the outcomes of different immunization schedules, and the study would have to span at least 6 to 10 years, meaning that it would likely cost the nation tens of millions of dollars.&#013;&#013;The committee acknowledges that large-scale, long-term studies of infants through adulthood would be informative for evaluating health outcomes associated with immunization.&#013;&#013;The most feasible approach to studying the safety of the childhood immunization schedule is through analyses of data obtained by VSD. VSD is a collaborative effort between CDC and 9 managed care organizations that maintain a large database of linked data for monitoring immunization safety and studying potential rare and serious adverse events. VSD member sites include data for more than 9 million children and adults receiving vaccinations on a variety of immunization schedules. However, children who are vaccinated on alternative schedules (including those who are not vaccinated) may differ in meaningful ways. Although this confounding can be minimized through matching and controlling for variations, differences in nonrandomly constructed cohorts cannot be fully accounted for by the use of these data.&#013;&#013;The committee discussed several potential modifications that could be introduced into this system that would enable new analyses of the key research questions (Box S-2), including collection of additional data on the participants. The committee found that secondary analyses within VSD would advance knowledge of the safety of the immunization schedule and identified enhancements to improve the data in VSD.&#013;&#013;One potential enhancement to VSD would be to collect additional demographic and, possibly, family history data for current participants. Basic information on vaccination history, child gender, race/ethnicity, and birth status (e.g., gestational age or birth weight) could be systematically collected for all participants. New approaches to the collection of additional data on a family history of allergies, autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, and the like should be considered. These data would permit analyses of the fourth research question (about potentially susceptible sub-populations) that cannot be readily conducted at this time.&#013;&#013;Most vaccine-related research focuses on the outcomes of single immunizations or combinations of vaccines administered at a single visit. Although each new vaccine is evaluated in the context of the overall immunization schedule that existed at the time of review of that vaccine, elements of the schedule are not evaluated once it is adjusted to accommodate a new vaccine. Thus, key elements of the entire schedule—the number, frequency, timing, order, and age at administration of vaccines—have not been systematically examined in research studies.&#013;&#013;Finally, the committee found that evidence assessing outcomes in sub-populations of children who may be potentially susceptible to adverse reactions to vaccines (such as children with a family history of autoimmune disease or allergies or children born prematurely) was limited and is characterized by uncertainty about the definition of populations of interest and definitions of exposures and outcomes."&#013;&#013;Institute of Medicine.

In addition, trials may purposely exclude subjects who could be more susceptible to AEs. For this reason, any comprehensive review of vaccine safety must include post-licensure studies, but these also have limitations. Large epidemiologic studies sometimes include any available formulation of vaccines against a particular disease and may not stratify results by dosage or formulation. For example, the relationship between the ‘seasonal influenza vaccine‘ and an AE could be studied over several years of data without considering the changes in formulation over the seasons or differentiating between live or inactive vaccine. In addition, people who avoid vaccinations (whether purposely or not) may differ from those who receive vaccinations in terms of race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and preexisting medical conditions, and these differences may be associated with health outcomes. Observational studies may attempt to control for such potential confounders by using matched cohorts or multivariate regression analysis; still, some factors such as environmental exposures may be unmeasured or challenging to adequately control for.&#013;&#013;The self-controlled case series was developed specifically to assess the safety of vaccines; this method eliminates confounding by all time-independent variables by using cases as their own controls and predefined ‘time windows‘ before and after vaccination.

[McKeown & Brown, 1955]: https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.1955.10404688 '"At first sight a list of developments in medicine during the eighteenth century seems impressive. It includes expansion of hospital, dispensary and midwifery services; notable changes in medical education; advances in understanding of physiology and morbid anatomy; and introduction of the first example of effective protective therapy (inoculation against smallpox). It is scarcely surprising that Griffith, like most other writers, should have concluded that these changes contributed materially to the health of the people. This conclusion derives from failure to distinguish clearly between the interests of the doctor and the interests of the patient, a common error in the interpretation of medical history. From the point of view of a student or practitioner of medicine, increased knowledge of anatomy, physiology and morbid anatomy are naturally regarded as important professional advances, as indeed they are. But from the point of view of the patient, none of these changes has any practical significance until such time as they contribute to preservation of health or recovery from illness. It is because there is often a substantial interval of time between acquisition of new knowledge and the possibility of any demonstrable benefit to the patient, that we cannot accept changes in medical education and institutions as evidence of the immediate effectiveness of medical effort. To arrive at a reliable opinion we must look closely at the work of doctors during the eighteenth century, and enquire whether in the light of modern knowledge it seems likely to have contributed to the health of their patients.&#013;&#013;To sum up. Three possible causes of a reduction of mOitality from infectious disease are considered: specific medical therapy; changes in the balance between the virulence of the infective organism and its host; and improvements in the environment. Reasons have been given previously for rejecting the first cause, and it is suggested that although there have undoubtedly been changes in the character of individual infections, it is unreasonable to attribute to this alone the progressive decline in mortality from infections as a whole, after many centuries in which mortality remained high. Improvements in the environment are therefore regarded as intrinsically the most acceptable explanation of the decline of mortality in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&#013;&#013;It is well recognised that in the late nineteenth century living conditions improved in ways which quite certainly influenced the course of the infectious diseases. Although there is no equally good evidence that living conditions improved in the last quarter of the eighteenth century-in some respects they probably deteriorated-it is quite conceivable that there was a general advance in the standard of living in consequence of the economic developments of the period. It is noted that whether we accept the birth rate or the death rate as the more important influence on the rise of the population, the conclusion that conditions improved in the late eighteenth century must follow rejection of the effectiveness of medical effort."&#013;&#013;McKeown, T., & Brown, R.

[McKinlay & McKinlay, 1977]: https://doi.org/10.2307/3349539 '"Certainly, from the evidence considered here, only poliomyelitis appears to have had a noticeably changed death rate subsequent to intervention. Even if it were assumed that this change was entirely due to the vaccines, then only about one percent of the decline following interventions for the diseases considered here (column d of Table 1) could be attributed to medical measures. Rather more conservatively, if we attribute some of the subsequent fall in the death rates for pneumonia, influenza, whooping cough, and diphtheria to medical measures, then perhaps 3.5 percent of the fall in the overall death rate can be explained through medical intervention in the major infectious diseases considered here. Indeed, given that it is precisely for these diseases that medicine claims most success in lowering mortality, 3.5 percent probably represents a reasonable upper-limit estimate of the total contribution of medical measures to the decline in mortality in the United States since 1900. [...] the introduction of specific medical measures and/or the expansion of medical services are generally not responsible for most of the modern decline in mortality."&#013;&#013;McKinlay, J.

Person-to-person infection is spread when a transmitting case comes in contact with a susceptible person. If the transmitting case only comes in contact with immune individuals, then the infection does not spread beyond the index case and is rapidly controlled within the population.&#013;&#013;Interestingly, this chain of human-to-human transmission can be interrupted, even if there is not 100% immunity, because transmitting cases do not have infinite contacts; this is referred to as “herd immunity” or “community protection,” and is an important benefit of vaccination.&#013;&#013;Mathematical modelers can estimate on average how many persons the typical transmitting case is capable of infecting if all of the contacts were susceptible (i.e., a population of 100% susceptibility). This number is known as R0, or the basic reproductive number. The immunity threshold needed within the population for terminating transmission can be calculated in percent as (R0 − 1)/R0 × 100 and is a guide to setting immunity levels and vaccination coverage targets for various diseases (8). For example, measles is one of the most contagious of vaccine-preventable diseases, with an estimated immunity threshold of 92–94%. In contrast, the protection threshold for rubella is estimated at 83–85%. Thus, eliminating rubella transmission is easier than measles, and when there are gaps in immunization coverage leading to accumulation of susceptibles, measles is often the first vaccine-preventable disease identified. Because of community protection induced by vaccines, persons who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., have contraindications or are younger than the age for whom vaccines are recommended), as well as persons who fail to make an adequate immune response to the vaccine (although most vaccines are highly effective, they are not 100% effective), can be protected indirectly because they are not exposed (Fig. 1). Thus, for most vaccines, achieving high levels of coverage is important not only for individual protection but in preventing disease in vulnerable populations that cannot be directly protected by vaccination. This provides the rationale for interventions to achieve high population immunity, such as removing barriers that may prevent access to vaccines (e.g., providing recommended vaccines without cost), as well as mandates for immunization requirements for attending school (9)."&#013;&#013;Orenstein, W.

To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 mo of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with B. pertussis at 7 mo. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naïve animals, and readily transmitted B. pertussis to unvaccinated contacts.Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naïve and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong B. pertussis-specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines."&#013;&#013;Warfel, J.

Vaccination is far too often employed, especially in the developing countries, to avoid the tedious, troublesome and sometimes expensive process of improving personal and environmental hygiene. Admittedly there are some diseases of which vaccination is the only effective means of control, but even so it should not be introduced for routine use without making reasonably sure that it can be carried out under conditions that will more or less guarantee its effectiveness. [...] Once a vaccine has been introduced, with apparently good results, it becomes extremely difficult ever to find out its real value. Moral objections may be too strong to permit a properly controlled trial. So long as there is some reason to believe that the vaccine is of benefit, it is considered unjustifiable to protect only a proportion of the children in a field trial and expose the others to the risk of the disease.

During 1991--2001, reports of deaths ranged from 1.4%--2.3%, and reports of life-threatening illness ranged from 1.4%--2.8% of all adverse event reports.

[...] The decrease in deaths reported to VAERS since 1992--1993 parallels the overall decrease in SIDS in the U.S. population since the implementation of the Back to Sleep campaign . Carefully controlled epidemiologic studies consistently have not found any association between SIDS and vaccines. FDA and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed 206 deaths reported to VAERS during 1990--1991. Only one death was believed to have resulted from a vaccine. The patient was a woman aged 28 years who died from Guillain-Barré syndrome after tetanus vaccination. IOM concluded that the majority of deaths reported to VAERS are temporally but not causally related to vaccination. A similar conclusion was reached regarding neonatal deaths temporally reported to VAERS in association with hepatitis B vaccination.
