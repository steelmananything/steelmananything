Here are one-sentence summaries steelmanning whether children aged 6 months through 4 years should get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine:

[**Mainstream**](/topics/children_vaccine_covid19/#steelman-for-children-aged-6-months-through-4-years-covid-may-cause-serious-medical-issues-including-death-the-pfizer-vaccine-is-likely-effective-in-reducing-covid-acquisition-its-estimated-benefits-including-reducing-community-transmission-outweigh-the-estimated-risks-of-side-effects-across-the-population-vaccination-may-have-benefits-in-addition-to-natural-immunity-vaccination-in-older-groups-is-associated-with-reduced-deaths-and-the-burden-of-proof-is-on-those-potentially-jeopardizing-their-children-and-their-community): For children aged 6 months through 4 years, COVID may cause serious medical issues including death, the Pfizer vaccine is likely effective in reducing COVID acquisition, its estimated benefits, including reducing community transmission, outweigh the estimated risks of side effects across the population, vaccination may have benefits in addition to natural immunity, vaccination in older groups is associated with reduced deaths, and the burden of proof is on those potentially jeopardizing their children and their community

[**Skeptical**](/topics/children_vaccine_covid19/#response-for-children-aged-6-months-through-4-years-that-are-healthy-risks-of-covid-19-may-be-similar-to-the-flu-influenza-virus-the-pfizer-vaccine-is-not-likely-very-effective-in-reducing-covid-acquisition-and-will-likely-wane-quickly-it-is-in-a-new-class-of-vaccines-with-limited-safety-data-community-benefits-are-unclear-population-wide-riskbenefit-calculations-do-not-account-for-individualized-assessments-and-value-judgments-natural-immunity-is-likely-robust-and-the-burden-of-proof-for-net-benefits-is-on-vaccine-providers): For children aged 6 months through 4 years that are healthy, risks of COVID-19 may be similar to the flu (influenza virus), the Pfizer vaccine is not likely very effective in reducing COVID acquisition and will likely wane quickly, it is in a new class of vaccines with limited safety data including more severe adverse reactions in the vaccine group compared to placebo, one child death in the equivalent Moderna vaccine trial in children under 6 compared to none in the placebo group, double the serious adverse event rate in the vaccine group compared to placebo in the equivalent Moderna vaccine trial and 24% higher all-cause mortality in the equivalent Pfizer adult clinical trial, community benefits are unclear, population-wide risk/benefit calculations do not account for individualized assessments and value judgments, natural immunity is likely robust, and the burden of proof for net benefits is on vaccine providers
