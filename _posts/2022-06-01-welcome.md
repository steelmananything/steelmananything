Steelmanning is another name for the [principle of charity in argumentation][Stevens, 2021] that tries to make the strongest possible argument for someone by [empathizing][Stueber & Zalta, 2019] with their positive intentions.

Steelmanning gets its name as the opposite of strawmanning. [Strawmanning][Aikin & Casey, 2011] is an argumentation [fallacy][Hansen & Zalta, 2020] in which a person's argument is made into a man of straw -- easy to knock down -- and then this strawman is argued against instead of what the person really meant. Straw conveys weakness because it's made from dry plant stalks whereas steel conveys strength because it's a [strong metal alloy][Hosford, 2012].

The main reason we like steelmanning here is its attempt to empathize with other people instead of just trying to win arguments. We hope that steelmanning improves relations between people and helps achieve the best possible world for everyone.
